- Gmapping package:

    The gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping),
    as a ROS node called slam_gmapping.
    slam_gmapping, helps creating a 2-D occupancy grid map (like a building floorplan)
    from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot.

- Navigation

    A 2D navigation stack that takes in information from odometry, 
    sensor streams, and a goal pose and outputs safe velocity commands that are sent to a mobile base.

- AMCL

    amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D. 
    It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo localization approach,
    which uses a particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.
